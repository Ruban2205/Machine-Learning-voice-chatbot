# ü§ñ Machine Learning Voice Chatbot

A simple voice recognition chatbot to help users with their voice inputs to get the information as a voice input using Speech Recognition python library. During the run time the program will ask the voice input from the user. User input is send to the openai website to fetch the data from the openai website to get the real-time data by using the openai API. 

This repository contains the code for a Machine Learning voice chatbot built using the OPEN AI API. The chatbot is designed to interact with users through voice commands and provide relevant responses based on natural language processing and machine learning algorithms.

## Languages and Tools üíª

- Python 
- openai 
- Visual Studio code 

## ü§ù Collaborators

This project has been developed in collaboration with [Jerusha S](https://github.com/jerusha-keira). Their contributions have been valuable in the development and improvement of the chatbot.

## üöÄ Installation

To set up and run the chatbot locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ruban2205/Machine-Learning-voice-chatbot.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies. It is recommended to use a virtual environment:
```
cd Machine-Learning-voice-chatbot
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows
```

3. Configure the API credentials for the OPEN AI API. You will need to obtain the necessary API key from OpenAI and set it as an environment variable or update the configuration file with your credentials.

4. Start the chatbot application:
```
python src/chatbot.py
```

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Usage
